> Vue 3 app to test composition, jsx, hooks, and vite

Libro is spanish for `book`. While building a book catalog app, I will test the Vue 3 api and try to write as much react in vue.

- [ ] Hooks to share reusable functions in components
- [ ] Context and provider for global settings like language and theme. [e.g.](https://markus.oberlehner.net/blog/context-and-provider-pattern-with-the-vue-3-composition-api/)
- [ ] [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)/[Zustand](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand)(hook based store)/[Overmind](https://overmindjs.org/) for the store. 
- [ ] Tailwind and SASS for styling
